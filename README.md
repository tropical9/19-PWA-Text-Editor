# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
This gist project was created for my coding bootdcamp. The goal of this challenge is to build a test editor that runs in the browser.It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by browser. This application will also function online.
